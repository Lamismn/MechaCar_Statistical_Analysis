# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview
This analysis uses R to study the performance of 50 models of Mechacar vehicles as well as the different suspension coil performance of three different manufacturing lots.
### Bacground
The data used in this study is from the following two files:
MechaCars performance: https://github.com/Lamismn/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/MechaCar_mpg.csv
Suspension coils: https://github.com/Lamismn/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Suspension_Coil.csv
## Linear regression to predict mpg
After performing a multiple linear regression analysis on the Mechacar data set, the output was as follows:
